This Project is divided between folders

## api

## index

### configure

Add configuration and services to your sails app

```javascript
sails.services['YourService'] = function() { };
sails.config = _.merge(sails.config, {object});
```

## test

First run `npm install`

Test your sails hook with mocha by running `npm test` before adding the hook to your redbox-portal. 
It may cause your application to not lift.    

```sh
$ npm test

> @uts-eresearch/sails-hook-redbox-template@1.0.0 test /Users/moises/source/code.research/sails-hook-redbox-template
> NODE_ENV=test node_modules/.bin/mocha
